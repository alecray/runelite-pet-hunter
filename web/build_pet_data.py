"""Regenerate the embedded <script id="pet-data"> block in pet-wheel.html.

Merges two pet datasets that already exist in this repo:

  - src/main/resources/com/alecray/pethunter/pets.json
    (wikiUrl, type, itemId, defaultTags, plus -- as of the 2026-09-05
    "attempts not kills" schema generalization -- rarity/attemptUnit/
    rollsPerAttempt/attemptsPerHour/methodNote/assumedRate/editable/womSkill
    for pets that have no pet_ranker.py timing row)
  - pet_ranker.py's PETS tuple
    (rarity, minutes-per-attempt, hiscore activity name, attempt_unit,
    rolls_per_attempt, assumed_rate -- kept there ONLY for fixed-rate boss
    kills and the hiscore-trackable roll/raid pets; see that module's
    docstring)

A pet is included in the wheel dataset if EITHER source can supply a timing
estimate: a pet_ranker.py PETS row, or pets.json's own attemptUnit/
attemptsPerHour fields. Two pets are permanently excluded regardless (see
EXCLUDED_PETS): Broav and Cat are quest rewards, not repeatable grinds, so
they have no attempt-based rate and don't belong on a hunt wheel.

When a pet has multiple PETS rows (different kill methods, e.g. Callisto
cub via Callisto or via Artio), the fastest method (lowest expected hours)
is used for the wheel's default weighting -- this mirrors pet_ranker.py's
own "quickest first" ranking philosophy.

Run this after editing pets.json or pet_ranker.py's PETS tuple:
